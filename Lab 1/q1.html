<h1>SEE THE BUG</h1>
<p>See the <b>bug</b> on the <b>rug</b><br>
I will give his lega a <b>tug</b><br>
See him run, see him <b>go</b><br>
He did not like it, <b>no! no!</b><br>
See him <b>hop</b>, on the <b>mop</b><br>
See him hide, make a <b>stop</b><br>
I will stop, I will not <b>tug</b><br>
You are safe, Little <b>bug</b></p>
